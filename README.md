> This project uses the Emscripten toolchain to compile this C++ project to WebAssembly. I have also used concepts of Minimax Algorithm to make AI game mode. We can choose custom difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). The project uses macros such as `EM_JS` and `EM_ASM` from Emscripten library. More info can be found on their documentation.
